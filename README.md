# Reusable Components in React

This project is part of my **Week 8 deliverable** as a front-end development intern at **Flexisaf**. It demonstrates how to build and structure **reusable React components** that are clean, styled, and efficient.

---

## Project Overview

The goal was to build at least six reusable UI components and present them on a single page. This promotes the **DRY principle** (Don't Repeat Yourself) and ensures better maintainability.

### Components Included

- **Button** – Customizable with label, variant, and disabled state
- **Input** – Reusable input field with label, type, and placeholder
- **Checkbox** – Toggleable checkbox with label
- **FormWrapper** – Wraps forms with consistent structure
- **Table** – Simple dynamic table with headers and row data
- **DataTable** – Enhanced table with search/filter functionality

---

## Built With

- React.js (via Vite or CRA)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- CSS for styling
